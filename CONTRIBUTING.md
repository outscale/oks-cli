## How to contribute

There are several ways to contribute to this project:

- **Report bugs** - Help us identify and fix issues
- **Suggest new features** - Propose improvements and new functionality
- **Fix existing bugs** - Resolve reported issues
- **Implement new features** - Turn approved ideas into working code
- **Improve the documentation** - Make our guides clearer and more helpful

## Report bugs

Before reporting a bug, check that it has not already been reported by consulting existing issues.

### How to report a bug

1. Use the "Bug Report" issue template
2. Provide a clear and concise description of the problem
3. Include steps to reproduce the bug
4. Specify your environment (OS, software version, etc.)
5. Add screenshots if relevant

### Information to include

- **Summary**: Short description of the problem
- **Reproduction Steps**: List of actions
- **Expected Behavior**: What should happen
- **Current Behavior**: What is actually happening
- **Environment**: Technical details of your configuration

## Suggest features

Suggestions for improvements are welcome! Before proposing a feature:

1. Check if the feature already exists
2. Review existing issues to avoid duplication
3. Choose the right issue template based on your intent :
  - **Suggest a New Feature** : Use this template if you have an idea for a feature but do not plan to implement it yourself. This helps the community discuss and evaluate it.
  - **Implement a New Feature** : Use this template if you have both a feature idea and plan to submit a pull request to implement it. This allows better coordination and avoids duplicated efforts.

### Proposal process

1. Open an issue using the "Feature Request" template
2. Clearly describe the problem your proposal solves
3. Explain your proposed solution
4. Mention the alternatives considered
5. Wait for feedback from the team
